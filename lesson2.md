# Lesson 2
Functions

# Reflection

* 1 thing you liked the best about last time
* 1 thing you were confused about last time - do you have any questions? 
* 1 thing you would be happy if it happened today during the hour and a half
and 
funny question of the day - talk about your team this summer!
* If you could have the perfect birthday party, what would it be?

# Our promises to each other
* we’ll take enough breaks to let our eyes and brains (no laptops) take a rest so that we can come back ready to focus and learn more
* we will help each other figure out things we don’t understand
* We will close our laptops when we’re all having a conversation so that we know we’re focused
* We will only use the internet to work on our current coding task

Anything else you think we should make sure we do? 

# Unplugged Activity
## You're the computer!

Someone volunteer to act out the instructions. 

Other two people take 5 minutes to come up with an algorithm that the "computer" can follow to do something - name it
This will be our function! You can tell them to do X and they will look at their paper and follow the steps of the algorithm!

*** nothing embarassing or that will hurt them, but silly is great! ***

Now, the computer will stand up and we can tell them things to do... "move forward 3 steps", "move backward 3 steps", "turn around", "sit down", etc...
but you can also tell them to do the thing on the paper!
Even loops! -- "do the thing on your paper 2 times"

That's what functions are like. 

So what do you think a function is? 
Definiton: A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.

* Pause on #9 - I'll go over the conditional and then we will go over them more next time

If you finish: Work on an hour of code of your choice!
