#Lesson 1


### Today we will: 
* **Get to know eachother**
  - My name is Samantha! I like making computers do really cool things using code. I also love dogs - I have two of them at home! Do you have a favorite animal? What about a favorite movie? I love Mulan and Tangled.
* **Find out what we've forgotten about code and what we remember**
  - It's ok to have forgotten! It's been a long time
* Draw some pictures using code! 

### First - vocabulary
* What is an algorithm? (A list of steps that you can follow to finish a task)
  - What's the algorithm to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? 
* What is a program? (An algorithm that has been coded into something that can be run by a machine -- that's what we code!)
  - Where do we see code in real life? (elevators! stop lights! automatic doors at the supermarket! airplanes!)

Before activity: 
* *My favorite thing about coding is that it's really important to work together with your friends to come up with your algorithms. Remember to ask for help and be willing to help others with their code!*
